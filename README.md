# PredictRecurrence

This project develops a machine learning-based predictor to assess the risk of recurrence in ER+ HER2- primary breast cancer patients. The goal is to identify patients who would benefit from additional chemotherapy or alternative treatments, optimizing personalized care.

The project uses clinical, transcriptomic, DNA methylation, and whole genome sequencing data to build a predictive model. Results will help tailor treatment strategies to reduce recurrence risk.

This repository includes Jupyter notebooks for data analysis and model development, as well as Python scripts for data processing and training the models.
